I'm not confident with the 'pull request' concept. 
As I understand, it's not a 'pull' it's more like a 'supervised merge'
What you pretend is to merge your 'local' branch to the main branch in GitHub
repository aka. 'origin'. HOWEVER you ask 'permission' to your colleguages
before doing the merge? It looks to me like a 'authorized push+merge'.
Moreover, in somehow in the video say that you can 'sincronize' the remote
branch with the local? What does it mean? It means that when someone pulls
you remote branchand makes commits you are notified and you get a copy of the
most recent version?
